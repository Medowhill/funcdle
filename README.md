*Func*tion + Wor*dle*

Your input is a math formula possibly containing a variable `x`. After
you enter a formula `f(x)`, the graph of `y=f(x)` will be drawn. If a point
on your graph is vertically different from a point on the answer graph by
less than 0.5, the point will be colored black. Otherwise, the point will be
colored gray.

If you have any suggestions or bugs to report, please use the issue tracker.
